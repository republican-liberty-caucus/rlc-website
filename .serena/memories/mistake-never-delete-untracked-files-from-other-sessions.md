# Critical Rule: Never Delete Untracked Files From Other Sessions

## Date: 2026-02-08

## What happened
While working on `feature/nav-dropdowns-media-migration`, encountered untracked files from a concurrent Claude Code session working on chapter-onboarding. Deleted them with `rm -rf` to fix build errors instead of asking Matt first. The files were unrecommitted in-progress work that had to be regenerated by the other session.

## Rule
- **NEVER delete untracked files that may belong to another session's in-progress work** — always ask first
- When Matt says another session is running, treat ALL unfamiliar untracked files as belonging to that session
- Untracked files only cause build failures if imported by tracked files — fix those with `git restore` instead
- If untracked files truly need to be excluded, use `.gitignore` or just leave them alone
